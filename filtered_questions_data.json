However, after a while you notice the cells are horrible quality and their real capacity caries significantly leading to an unbalanced accumulator.\nHe performed experiments to find an approximation of the cells SoC relation to their open-circuit volage (EMF) as shown in the following figure:\nAssume due to imbalance, exactly half of the accumulators cells are at 40% SoC and half at 80% SoC. What current will be drawn at the maximum allowed power usage? (answer in A)\nRound the voltage in the figure and the answer to the nearest decimal (e.g. 3.15V becomes 3.2V and 1.15 A becomes 1.2 A)\nPlease use the following format: 12.3 or 1.23 (no ',' comma, no latters), round to 3 significant digits.",

It therefore seems, as the sampled returned value is not the one expected, that the sampling is done incorrectly and therefore C is the correct answer. As for sending the data, seeing that the signal on the MISO line is high until the deassert of the CS line, it is correctly sampled by the chip you are communicating to. \\n CS deassertion can always happen during command send and response receive.\\n The clock frequency is correct as the output traces of the MOSI line is showing the correct bits.

As an extension to your workshop is imminent, you want to know whether the output of the gas turbine is sufficient. How it works: In the gas turbine, air is compressed adiabatically and reversibly (1 → 2), then heated isobarically (2 → 3) and expanded adiabatically and reversibly (3 → 4). In the subsequent heat exchanger, isobaric cooling of the air from T4 to T5 causes a water mass flow of boiling liquid (6) to evaporate isobarically just completely (7). The flow diagram is shown in the following figure as well as further details.\\n Assumptions:\\n - Air can be regarded as an ideal gas.\\n - Water is a real substance.- It is a stationary flow process.\\n - All components are adiabatic to the outside.\\n - Differences in kinetic and potential energies can be neglected.\\n What is the efficiency of the gas turbine in percent (total of the components compressor, heat supply and expander)?\\n Round to two decimal places.

Answer in deg and provide the value with 1 decimal place, e.g. 12.3. ",

To obtain his greatest wish he dreamed of last week, he wants to use one of his team’s previous FS cars with some modifications. This vehicle has a mass of 180 kg, 2.35 m2 frontal area, a downforce coefficient of 3.5 and a drag coefficient of 0.8. He fits tires with a friction coefficient of 1.8 (assume cylindrical friction ellipses) and a rolling resistance coefficient of 0.1. For the gravitational acceleration, assume the value that can be measured at the Hungaroring (ca. Budapest) rounded to 2 decimals. On the day of driving, George sees that the temperatures reach room temperature values according to ISO 13443 natural gas reference conditions. As he steps on the scale to measure his own weight, he also sees, that the poppy seed rolls from Christmas are still measurable in his belly and he still weighs 15 kg. At least how much speed does he need to maintain while driving on the ceiling when the stated circumstances occur? Assume just the main forces acting on George and his vehicle (a point mass may be equivalent) in an equilibrium state to determine the minimum needed speed in a moment of bottom-up driving. Mark the answer rounded to the integer value of the minimal speed needed.",

He fits tires with a friction coefficient of 1.8 (assume cylindrical friction ellipses) and a rolling resistance coefficient of 0.1. For the gravitational acceleration, assume the value that can be measured at the Hungaroring (ca. Budapest) rounded to 2 decimals . On the day of driving, George sees that the temperatures reach room temperature values according to ISO 13443 natural gas reference conditions. As he steps on the scale to measure his own weight, he also sees, that the poppy seed rolls from Christmas are still measurable in his belly and he still weighs 15 kg. At least how much speed does he need to maintain wh ile driving on the ceiling when the stated circumstances occur? Assume just he main forces acting on George and his vehicle (a point mass may be equivalent) in an equilibrium state to determine the minimum needed speed in a moment of bottom up driving. Mark the answer rounded to the integer value of the minimal speed needed.",

                "text": "Answer b) is correct, only the proposal B) is a plausible explanation. The others are either bad practice or wrong measures even if the failure scenario is correct. \\n\nThe watchdog is a timer with a period equal to the fastest tasks cycle time plus its estimated maximum execution time. The timer is usually reset at the end of the fastest task execution.\\n\nIf the reset doesn’t happen, the ISR of the timer is triggered which results in a watchdog timeout.\\n\nAs the motor control task is the most critical one (shortest cycle time and highest priority, except for watchdog), the watchdog reset is done here. If the watchdog reset is implemented correctly, a timeout can only occur, if something interrupts the motor control task.\\n\nConsequently, only an ISR is capable of blocking the watchdog reset and cause a timeout. Another possible scenario would be, if the execution of the motor control task is taking too long. However none of the provided tips is pointing in this direction. The capture/compare timer input (for pump speed evaluation) is usually connected to an ISR. Common or good practice for such an application is to evaluate the PWM signal inside the ISR, save the value (e.g. duty cycle) to a global variable and process it outside of the ISR.\\n\nEven the calculation of a flow rate inside the ISR would not take too much computation time but maybe require additional data from other software modules (e.g. information about the cooling ciruit) which may result in less data encapsulation and therefore is considered bad practice.\\n\nA display update is usually done via sendig signals on a bus (like UART, I2C or SPI) to the display. Depending on the display, its resolution and other parameters, this can take quite a lot of messages to transfer all the information to the display. Furthermore, parameters like the bus speed or timing requirements may further increase the needed time.\\n\nIf all these actions are done in the ISR, this may block the motor control task from execution too long to reset the watchdog timer before the timeout happens.",
